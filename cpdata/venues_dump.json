All studios are heated to 80-90 degrees using state-of-the-art infrared technology, which helps create a detoxifying sweat that stimulates blood circulation and increases flexibility. In this music-driven practice, you will flow along to tracks ranging from A Tribe Called Quest to Cardi B. Classes are held in a dark, candlelit room with no mirrors to encourage you to turn your focus inward and explore your individual practice. The practice includes a centering warm up leading into the core vinyasa flows, a challenging mini-burn designed to push your personal edge and a relaxing cool-down with savasana rest. Using verbal cues, the instructor will guide you through three sequences repeated three times each. The first time through the sequence, the instructor will break down the alignment in each posture. The second time through, you will repeat the same sequence and speed things up linking one-breath to one-movement. Finally, you will have the opportunity to take that sequence on your own during our signature Flow On Your Own portion of class. Add in challenges and modifications, or take out postures that don't serve you. We flow hard.",

This accessible, challenging and flowing form of yoga will lead you to a state of transformation â€“ it will sculpt, tone and hone the muscles of your body and mind. The room is heated to a hot but comfortable 95 degrees to encourage detoxification, deeper stretching and healing. Class is open to all students; modifications and variations are offered to serve the needs of all experience levels. Get ready to take your practice seriously, but yourself lightly as you explore your edge, discover your strength, and awaken your spirit.",

You will gain health and flexibility and train your muscles to work together. This is a workout style class.

Having a 9-5 (or 7-7) office job in Finance, She always made time to be physically active, run a few races and complete a triathlon. After years of being a student both in class and lots of reading on her own, she decided it was time to share how she feels about wellness and fitness. Years later the opportunity to become a BBBCÂ® coach came about. Join her for a butt kicking session so you can experience smart training with her! You will not look back!",

These accessible but challenging sessions are meditative methods of movement that not only promote health and longevity, but also help you to develop whole-body coordinated actions and movements that carry over to all other activities in your life. As you move slowly with focused attention, chains of muscles contract and relax synergistically without engaging the inhibitory reflexes that can interfere with the movements reducing the applied force of the bodys innate strength and ability.",
